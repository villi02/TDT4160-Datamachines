# TDT4160 Computer Fundamentals

Welcome to the repository containing the different practice sets for the course TDT4160 Computer Fundamentals, taken summer 2024.

These practice sets consists of code written in assembly, where each set looks to solve simple problems that a computer mostly does for us when we write in higher level languages. In other words, these practice sets are a step back to the fundementals of computers.

## [1. Theoretical with some simple computer architecture questions](Pset1)

## [2. Find sum of each pair of values in array](Pset2)

## [3. Check if quadratic number in register](Pset3)

## [4. Sort values in register](Pset4)
